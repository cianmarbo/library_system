In order to run this project, you will need to follow these instructions.

*** DEPENDENCIES - DON'T WORRY IT'S NOT TOO BAD!! ***

My implementation uses the NodeJS "Sequelize" framework as an ORM which allows it to interface with
different types of databases, including MySQL, Postgres, and more. However, I have only tested it
with Postgres.

I have included a backup of my library database in the folder "database_backup" - you will need to
restore this file, which is just a text file containing SQL statements, to your own db.

You can install Postgres on your machine here: https://www.postgresql.org

You can restore my database backup to a database on your own machine by running the following postgres
command in the terminal:

pg_restore -U postgres -d mydb database_backup/library_db_export.pgsql

where "mydb" is the name of your database. Note that I'm assuming you are in the root of this project
when running this command.

You will need to install NodeJS on your host machine, which you can find here (https://nodejs.org/en)
and then make sure your working directory in the terminal is the root of this project.

You will then need to run npm update which will use the package.json file in this project to install
the necessary dependencies this project requires (express, sequelize).

**** NOTE - THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! ****

You will NEED to change the connection string on line 10 of server.js:

"postgres://cianmarbo@localhost:5432/library"

Here you need to replace "cianmarbo" with whatever account you are logged into on your host machine.
You will also need to replace "library" with whatever your db is called if it is not called "library".
I admit this is a gap in functionality....

If you do not do the above, the project will *not* work

*****************************************

**** TO RUN THE PROJECT ****

In the project root directory run

node server.js

This will start the server

Once the server has started and there are no errors you can visit the site by entering
